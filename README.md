## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local development environment running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, get a copy of the project on your machine.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Kapilbhadu0017/Testrepo.git](https://github.com/Kapilbhadu0017/Testrepo.git)
cd Testrepo

### 2. Configure API Keys

The backend needs API keys to function.

1.  In the `backend` folder, rename the file `env.example` to `.env`.
2.  Open the new `.env` file and add your actual API keys. You will need keys for:
      - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (from Google AI Studio)
      - `WAQI_TOKEN` (from the World Air Quality Index Project)
      - `AIRNOW_API_KEY` (from AirNow)
      - `MONGODB_URL` (from your MongoDB Atlas cluster)

### 3. Install All Dependencies

This project has both Node.js (frontend) and Python (backend) dependencies. Run the following commands from the **main project folder**:

```bash
# Install all frontend packages
npm run install:all

# Install all backend packages
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

This single command starts both the backend and frontend servers at the same time.

```bash
npm run dev
```
